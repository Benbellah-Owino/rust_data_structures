This is a crate with the rust implementation of common / Basic  rust data structures.
Most of the code will be written in mod.rs and the main code is nothing but testing code, I will write tests later.
Run the project with the normal cargo run.

DATA STRUCTURES INCLUDED ( Datastructure( Accepted DataType )):
                          * Queue(i32)
